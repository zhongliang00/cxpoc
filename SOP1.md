If the customer's enquiry is about a failed transaction, check if the customer [has any late payments](has_late_payments()), if so, [tell the customer](reply_customer()) to settle their outstanding bill first. Otherwise, [check their order id in their system](lookup_order_id()) to determine their failure reason. In the case of FRAUD_REJECTED, [tell the customer](reply_customer()) to try again in 90 days.
